# Enterprise Minecraft Laws - Complete Framework

Professional development standards for scalable, maintainable Minecraft Bedrock scripting with AI assistance and private repository validation.

## üìã Laws Overview

| Law | Category | Priority | Description |
|-----|----------|----------|-------------|
| [Law 1](core-principles#law-1) | API Stability | üî¥ Critical | Stable API enforcement with repository validation |
| [Law 2](core-principles#law-2) | Architecture | üü° Required | Modular file structure for growth |
| [Law 3](core-principles#law-3) | Persistence | üî¥ Critical | Dynamic Properties only with wrapper |
| [Law 4](architecture#law-4) | Error Handling | üî¥ Critical | Enterprise error management |
| [Law 5](architecture#law-5) | Performance | üü° Required | 10ms tick limits with monitoring |
| [Law 6](architecture#law-6) | Security | üü° Required | Input validation and permissions |
| [Law 7](development#law-7) | Workflow | üü¢ Recommended | Development and changelog standards |
| [Law 8](development#law-8) | Build Tools | üü¢ Recommended | TypeScript and quality tooling |
| [Law 9](development#law-9) | Conventions | üü° Required | Naming and style standards |
| [Law 10](scaling#law-10) | Scalability | üü° Required | Future-proofing and expansion |

## üéØ Core Principle

**Projects expand over time** - design all code for scalability, modularity, and long-term maintenance from day one.

## üîó Private Repository Integration

All laws validated against controlled private forks:
- **`013sc3n3/bedrock-samples`** (forked from Mojang/bedrock-samples)
- **`013sc3n3/minecraft-scripting-libraries`** (forked from Mojang/minecraft-scripting-libraries)
- **`013sc3n3/minecraft-debugger`** (forked from Mojang/minecraft-debugger)
- **`013sc3n3/minecraft-creator-tools`** (forked from Mojang/minecraft-creator-tools)

### Repository Validation Process
1. **API Verification**: All suggested APIs must have working examples in private samples
2. **Pattern Validation**: Code patterns verified against private scripting libraries
3. **Debugging Integration**: VS Code debugging patterns validated against private debugger fork
4. **Tooling Compliance**: Build and validation workflows verified against private creator-tools
5. **Compliance Checking**: Automated validation against private repository standards
6. **Version Control**: Laws updated based on private repository evolution

## üìö Law Categories

### üî¥ Critical Laws (Runtime Failures)
Must be followed or code will fail at runtime:
- **[Law 1: API Stability](core-principles#law-1)** - Wrong APIs cause crashes
- **[Law 3: Persistence](core-principles#law-3)** - Data loss without proper handling
- **[Law 4: Error Handling](architecture#law-4)** - Unhandled errors crash features

### üü° Required Laws (Team Collaboration)
Essential for professional development:
- **[Law 2: Architecture](core-principles#law-2)** - Enables feature isolation and team development
- **[Law 5: Performance](architecture#law-5)** - Prevents server lag and performance issues
- **[Law 6: Security](architecture#law-6)** - Input validation and permission management
- **[Law 9: Conventions](development#law-9)** - Consistent code across team
- **[Law 10: Scalability](scaling#law-10)** - Supports project growth

### üü¢ Recommended Laws (Professional Polish)
Best practices for enterprise development:
- **[Law 7: Workflow](development#law-7)** - Professional development processes
- **[Law 8: Build Tools](development#law-8)** - Quality tooling and automation
